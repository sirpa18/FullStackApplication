# FullStackApplication

This can be used as a template for any full stack registration template.
MongoDB, Postman and Python Flask are used.

The structure of the file is :

FullStackApplication
- application
  -__init__.py
  - forms.py
  - models.py
  - routes.py
  - static
    - css folder
    - images folder
  - templates
    - all html files given in the repository
    - includes folder
      - header
      - footer
- config.py
- main.py
- requirements.txt

Can use any editor. I have used VS Code editor for creating virtual env and to run the application in localhost.
